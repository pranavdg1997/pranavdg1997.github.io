# Summary
I'm an experienced Data Scientist specializing in using Natural Language technologies in healthcare data. Currently I work in healtcare consulting domain where I hold nearly 2 years of experience. I recently also graduated with a Masters in Data Science from Indiana University (May 2021). I have also worked for an additional 1.5 years in academic research and am a recippient of *Luddy Outstanding Research Award* from Indiana University. I also hold a deep interest and have recently worked on academic research in Reinforcement Learning.\\
On a personal level I hold a passion for writing - both journalistic and creative and am open to learning opportunities in the same.I won't call myself a pro-gamer but I do have a decent gaming setup and enjoy the occasional Call-of-Duty sessions. My guilty pleasures are watching Wrestling (WWE,AEW,etc) and rewatching Rick And Morty episodes which I think is the best TV show ever made.


# Positions (Chronologically):

## Senior Data Science Associate - ZS Associates (May 2021 - Present)
Continuing at my previous firm (see below position from July 2018 - July 2019), currently I specialize in projects involving Natural Language technlogies. My role now involves more client-facing time, direct project building and leading Data Science workflows.

##  Research Associate - Indiana University (January 2020 - May 2021)
### Building a Mind Lab - Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision
I worked on a Cognitive Science project, the basic objective of which is to reverse engineer Vision and object detection processes in animal, with our test animal being new-born chickens. Based on actual observations, we simulated the animal behaviour in the Unity platform. While in practise the animal sees the whole image, we supplied the artifical agent with transformed and dimension-reduced images (using Variational Autoenecoders, SimCLR model, etc) to see if it performed the task successfully. We used these experiment to draw inferences on how animal brains transform complicated information to simpler representations based on tasks.
### Big Data and Quantitative trading 
Working under [Professor Jeff McMullin](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/profile.cshtml?id=JEMCMULL), I helped him scale his trading algorithm to PySpark based pipeline utilizing University AWS servers. I also built a GUI for easy use and visualizations. Refer to following for a brief demo of our app -

Currently I'm in a Research position at [Prof Sunandan Chakroborty's Lab](https://sunchak.pages.iu.edu/causal/index.html), with the [Indiana Universityâ€“Purdue University Indianapolis](https://www.iupui.edu/). I'm also in the last semester of my studies at Indiana University, Bloomington.\\
I am working on using Reinforcement Learning to perform information extractive task on unlabelled textual data. The extraction in question involves cause-effect entities from domain specific data with each example being a not to large sentence. For instance consider the sentence "Deficieny of Vitamin C leads to a disease called Scurvy.". The pipeline should identify this sentence as having a cause-effect relationship, and further idenitfy the entities 'Deficiency of Vitamin C' and 'a disease called Scurvy' as the 'cause' and 'effect' entities respectively. The reason behind using RL is to create a pipeline robust of domain and extractive nature, and without the need of manual annotation. 

## Research Assisstant - Reinforcement Learning (January 2021 - May 2021)


## Teaching / Research Assisstant - Deep Learning for Bioinformatics (May 2020 - Present)
This position involved creating course content slides as well as programming assignments to cover Deep Learning from basics to advanced applications in Bioinformatics. Apart from course content, I also assissted with migrating older repositories of DL applications based on deprecated tools to more modern frameworks.

## Research Assistant - Big Data and Quantitave trading (January 2020 - May 2020)
Working under , I built worflows to automate end-to-end processing of portfolio data to easily readable network graphs and a GUI application for customized visualization.

## Data Science Associate - ZS Associates (July 2018 - July 2019)
As a Data Scientist in the healthcare consulting industry, I worked on several projects involving core technical skills as well as some client facing time. The former was critical for me to learn the nuances of this field outside of technical innovation, and why the ability to explain, negotiate and exchange information with the client is just as important.
