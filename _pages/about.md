I’m an experienced Data Scientist specializing in using Natural Language technologies in healthcare data. Currently I work in healthcare consulting domain where I hold close to **2 years of professional experience**. I recently graduated with a Masters in Data Science from Indiana University (May 2021). I have also worked for an additional 1.5 years in academic research and am a recipient of *Luddy Outstanding Research Award* from Indiana University. I have recently spent considerable time exploring Reinforcement Learning and utilizing the game-solving setup in real applications. I like making Open Source contributions for Deep Learning architectures and educational posts from time to time.

On a personal level I hold a passion for writing - both journalistic and creative and am open to learning opportunities in the same. I won’t call myself a pro-gamer but I do have a decent gaming setup and enjoy the occasional Call-of-Duty sessions. My guilty pleasures are watching Wrestling (WWE, AEW, etc.) and re-watching episodes of *Rick And Morty* which I think is the best TV show ever made.


# Positions (Chronologically):

## Senior Data Science Associate - ZS Associates (May 2021 - Present)
Continuing at my previous firm (see below position from July 2018 - July 2019), currently I specialize in projects involving Natural Language technlogies. My role now involves more client-facing time, direct project building and leading Data Science workflows.

##  Research Associate (January 2020 - May 2021)
### [Building a Mind Lab](http://buildingamind.com/) - Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision
I worked on a Cognitive Science project, the basic objective of which is to reverse engineer Vision and object detection processes in animals, with our test animal being new-born chickens. Based on actual observations, we simulated the animal behaviour in the Unity platform ina Reinforcement Learning setup. While in practise the animal sees the whole raw image, we supplied the artifical agent with transformed and dimension-reduced images (using Variational Autoenecoders, SimCLR model, etc) to see if it performed the task successfully. We used these experiments to draw inferences on how the animal brain transforms complicated information to simpler representations based onthe task at hand.

### [IUPUI Data Lab](https://data.soic.iupui.edu/) - Natural Language Processing
I worked on and lead a small team to work an NSF funded project involving extraction causal relationships from Natural Language text. This project is part of a much larger initiative to generate structred information and narrative from large pieces of medical publications.

### [Kelley School of business](https://kelley.iu.edu/) -Big Data and Quantitative trading 
Working under [Professor Jeff McMullin](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/profile.cshtml?id=JEMCMULL), I helped him scale his trading algorithm to PySpark based pipeline utilizing University AWS servers. I also built a GUI for easy use and visualizations. Refer to [<ins>this<\ins>](https://github.com/pranavdg1997/pranavdg1997.github.io/blob/master/images/zoom_0.gif) link to preview a demo of the app.

## Data Science Associate - ZS Associates (July 2018 - July 2019)
As a Data Scientist in the healthcare consulting industry, I worked on several projects involving core technical skills as well as some client facing time. The latter was critical for me to learn the nuances of this field outside of technical innovation, and why the ability to explain, negotiate and exchange information with the client is just as important.
