# Summary
I am an MS ('21) student with advanced knowledge in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I have a passion for building AI solutions and learning new technologies and concepts along the way. Apart from backend as well as developmental programming, I keep a working knowledge of Statistics, cutting-edge Deep Learning and NLP techniques. \\
I have a total of 2 years of work experience, a year as a full time Data Scientist (industry), and another year as a Machine Learning Researcher (academia). Over the past year, I have tried to build a niche in Deep Reinforcement Learning and its applications. \\
I believe what I bring to the table are strong technical R&D skills, along with a keen outlook towards product management and a consulting approach. I am to full time positions starting May 2021 and also for Co-ops for Spring 2021.


# Positions (Chronologically):

## NLP-RL Research(May 2020 - Present)
Currently I'm in a Research position at [Prof Sunandan Chakroborty's Lab](https://sunchak.pages.iu.edu/causal/index.html), with the [Indiana Universityâ€“Purdue University Indianapolis](https://www.iupui.edu/). I'm also in the last semester of my studies at Indiana University, Bloomington.\\
I am working on using Reinforcement Learning to perform information extractive task on unlabelled textual data. The extraction in question involves cause-effect entities from domain specific data with each example being a not to large sentence. For instance consider the sentence "Deficieny of Vitamin C leads to a disease called Scurvy.". The pipeline should identify this sentence as having a cause-effect relationship, and further idenitfy the entities 'Deficiency of Vitamin C' and 'a disease called Scurvy' as the 'cause' and 'effect' entities respectively. The reason behind using RL is to create a pipeline robust of domain and extractive nature, and without the need of manual annotation. 

## Teaching / Research Assisstant - Deep Learning for Bioinformatics (May 2020 - Present)
This position involved creating course content slides as well as programming assignments to cover Deep Learning from basics to advanced applications in Bioinformatics. Apart from course content, I also assissted with migrating older repositories of DL applications based on deprecated tools to more modern frameworks.

## Research Assistant - Big Data and Quantitave trading (January 2020 - May 2020)
Working under [Professor Jeff McMullin](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/profile.cshtml?id=JEMCMULL), I built worflows to automate end-toend processing of portfolio data to easily readable network graphs and a GUI application for customized visualization.

## Data Science Assocuate - ZS Associates (July 2018 - July 2019)
As a Data Scientist in the healthcare consulting industry, I worked on several projects involving core technical skills as well as client facing time. The former was critical for me to learn the nuances of this field outside of technical innovation, and why the ability to explain, negotiate and exchange information with the client is just as important.
