Soon to complete Masters in Data Science (summer '21) | NLP Researcher | Data Scientist


## Current work:

Currently I'm in a Researcher position at [Prof Sunandan Chakroborty's Lab](https://sunchak.pages.iu.edu/causal/index.html), with the [Indiana Universityâ€“Purdue University Indianapolis](https://www.iupui.edu/). I'm also in the last semester of my studies at Indiana University, Bloomington.

I am working on using Reinforcement Learning to perform information extractive task on unlabelled textual data. The extraction in question involves cause-effect entities from domain specific data with each example being a not to large sentence. For instance consider the sentence "Deficieny of Vitamin C leads to a disease called Scurvy.". The pipeline should identify this sentence as having a cause-effect relationship, and further idenitfy the entities 'Deficiency of Vitamin C' and 'a disease called Scurvy' as the 'cause' and 'effect' entities respectively. The reason behind using RL is to create a pipeline robust of domain and extractive nature, and without the need of manual annotation.
