I’m an experienced ML researcher and Applied Data Scientist, with 2+ years of professional experience and prominent publications (NeuRIPS, ACM, Intellisys). Currently I work as a Data Scientist at Sam's Club (Walmart Global Tech) specializing in causal inference projects. I graduated with a Masters in Data Science from Indiana University (May 2021). I have also worked for an additional 1.5 years in academic research and am a recipient of *Luddy Outstanding Research Award* from Indiana University. I have spent considerable time exploring Reinforcement Learning and utilizing the game-solving setup in real applications. I continue making Open Source contributions for Deep Learning architectures and educational posts from time to time.

On a personal level I hold a passion for writing - both journalistic and creative and am open to learning opportunities in the same. I won’t call myself a pro-gamer but I do have a decent gaming setup and enjoy the occasional Call-of-Duty sessions. My guilty pleasures are watching Wrestling (WWE, AEW, etc.) and re-watching episodes of *Rick And Morty* which I think is the best TV show ever made. I reside in Dallas, TX and

# Positions (Chronologically):

## Data Scientist - Walmart Global Tech Associates (January 2022 - Present)
At Sam's Club Tech, I was fortunate to be part of a team that embraced data science to enhance the company's progress. While there, I had a hand in developing an anomaly detection engine, which incorporated real-time user feedback, capturing anomalies with a rate exceeding 70%. I also contributed to the creation of a causal-inference forecast model that explained more than 80% variance and maintained a global error of under 5%. These efforts assisted in making sales of approximately $1.6 Billion more understandable and transparent.
\\
Additionally, I was involved in the establishment of a Rest API solution, working to optimize its runtime for Azure cloud deployment and ensuring alignment with best industry practices for CI/CD. By tapping into Generative AI and LLMs, I helped devise techniques that realized about 80% cost-effectiveness in data enhancement and curation. While I've been fortunate to gain diverse experiences in the field, I continue to learn and believe I can contribute meaningfully to roles centered around data science, where I hope to bridge theory with its real-world applications. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had so far and am eager to further collaborate and learn in future endeavors.

## Senior Data Science Associate - ZS Associates (May 2021 - December 2021)
I continued contributing to projects I worked on previously (occupying client facing role) while also working on an interesting NLP project from scratch

##  Research Associate (January 2020 - May 2021)
### [Building a Mind Lab](http://buildingamind.com/) - Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision
I worked on a Cognitive Science project, the basic objective of which is to reverse engineer Vision and object detection processes in animals, with our test animal being new-born chickens. Based on actual observations, we simulated the animal behaviour in the Unity platform ina Reinforcement Learning setup. While in practise the animal sees the whole raw image, we supplied the artifical agent with transformed and dimension-reduced images (using Variational Autoenecoders, SimCLR model, etc) to see if it performed the task successfully. We used these experiments to draw inferences on how the animal brain transforms complicated information to simpler representations based onthe task at hand.

### [IUPUI Data Lab](https://data.soic.iupui.edu/) - Natural Language Processing
I worked on and lead a small team to work an NSF funded project involving extraction causal relationships from Natural Language text. This project is part of a much larger initiative to generate structred information and narrative from large pieces of medical publications.

### [Kelley School of business](https://kelley.iu.edu/) -Big Data and Quantitative trading 
Working under [Professor Jeff McMullin](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/profile.cshtml?id=JEMCMULL), I helped him scale his trading algorithm to PySpark based pipeline utilizing University AWS servers. I also built a GUI for easy use and visualizations. Refer to [<ins>this</ins>](https://github.com/pranavdg1997/pranavdg1997.github.io/blob/master/images/zoom_0.gif) link to preview a demo of the app.

## Data Science Associate - ZS Associates (July 2018 - July 2019)
As a Data Scientist in the healthcare consulting industry, I worked on several projects involving core technical skills as well as some client facing time. The latter was critical for me to learn the nuances of this field outside of technical innovation, and why the ability to explain, negotiate and exchange information with the client is just as important.
