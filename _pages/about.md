## About Me

I’m an experienced ML researcher and Applied Data Scientist with 6+ years of professional experience and prominent publications (NeuRIPS, ACM, Intellisys). Currently, I work as a Senior AI Engineer at Cigna Health, specializing in cutting-edge Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) applications for healthcare solutions. 

Previously, I worked at Walmart Global Tech, contributing to significant advancements in causal inference, Generative AI systems, and anomaly detection engines. I hold a Master's degree in Data Science from Indiana University (May 2021), where I was honored with the *Luddy Outstanding Research Award*. My journey includes 1.5 years of academic research, focusing on reinforcement learning and NLP, and numerous impactful projects that bridge theoretical ML concepts with real-world applications.

On a personal level, I am passionate about writing — both journalistic and creative—and recently I have been coaching young professionals to navigate through this turbulent job market and landing their job (Reach out if you want to be added to the community of job seekers)
